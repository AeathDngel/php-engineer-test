## Test

### 0. Please use the PSR2 coding standards if you know them. If you don't, that's OK - *it will not count against you.*

### 1. Fork this repo

The test will be considered complete when you send a link to your repo. It must be forked from this one.

As good practice, commit each stage of this test before moving to the next.

### 2. Add the required dependancies via composer.

Some have been included already so just include the following one: `composer require nategood/httpful`. Read more [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md)

### 3. Hello World!

Let's get down to writing down some code. We're assuming that you know how to create a PHP file and `echo 'Hello World';`. So let's jump straight in. 

### 4. Implement a class

Using the existing class, output a square which is 10 "pixels" wide.

### 5. Extend a class

Extend the Shape class to create a diamond that works with any passed length. 

### 6. Fix a class

Fix the Rectangle class. It has a number of coding standards errors, syntax errors and logic errors.

### 7. Use Httpful to do an API call

Do a GET request to `http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/mewtwo/` and output 3 items from the result (remember to help us understand what is being output using item label / name).

### 8. Suggest an improvement to the test

We believe in collective knowledge. Suggest a way (any constructive way) that can improve this test.
